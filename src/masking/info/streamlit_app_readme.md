# Readme

This application is built by Rohit Gupta, **Infonomy Group** of Cyber Security RA, TCS Research.

This application features three tabs namely

1. Home.
2. Privacy Config Manager.
3. Readme.

## :house: Home Tab

The Home tab features the anonymization module where one can visualize the anonymization done on service tickets. Two buttons are provided to interact with tool namely *Next Ticket* and *Reset*. The *Next Ticket* loads the next ticket after which tool quantifies the sensitivity and anonymizes according to the selected *privacy factor*.
The *Reset* button resets the system.

## :gear: Privacy Config Manager

This tab takes the attributes present in system as input and gives the vulnerability rating and disclosure proportion according to privacy factor given and attiribute categorization. Using this tab we can set the masking policy which will be applied across the system.

## :book: Readme Tab

This is called recursion :wink:.
